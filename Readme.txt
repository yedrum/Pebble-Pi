Conect usb cables:

hd cam - right port.
sd cam (the smaller one) - left back port. 
arduino - front left port.

There are 2 prototypegui files in the islandstone file folder on the desktop.

Open the prototypegui.fig file (not the .m file). If you open the .m file you'll just need to press 'run' or f5 to get to the gui. 

Wait for serial connection to the Arduino for servo control 

(you'll see the arduino connecting... command in the matlab command window) 

video feeds should begin. 

any errors? just close matlab and start again. 
if it can't read the cams. just close matlab and start again.
you might have to disconnect and reconnect the arduino cable if it says it can't establish comms.
